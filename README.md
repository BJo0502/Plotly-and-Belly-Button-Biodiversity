# Module 12: Plotly and Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
The intent of this project is to create a dashboard that visualizes the types of bacteria discovered in the belly buttons of various volunteers. After discovering the type of bacteria colonized in their belly buttons, volunteers may have the opportunity to sell their bacteria to a company called Improbable Beef to assist in the study and synthetic beef production.

The dashboard allows a volunteer to select their ID number from the dropdown and displays their corresponding demographic information, weekly frequency of belly button scrubs, the top 10 types of bacteria discovered, and the sample size of all bacteria grouped by type found in their belly buttons.

The following deliverables are required: create a horizontal bar chart, create a bubble chart, create a gauge chart, and customize the dashboard.
